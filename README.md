## Adjust the brightness of your screen.

First open a terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T
to find your monitorâ€™s name, Type
```sh
xrandr | grep " connected" | cut -f1 -d " "
```
Now type 
```sh
xrandr --output your-monitor-name --brightness brightness-level
```
For example
```sh
$ xrandr | grep " connected" | cut -f1 -d " "
VGA1
$ xrandr --output VGA1 --brightness 0.7
```
In my case, the name of my monitor was VGA1 so, I used VGA1 as the monitor name and changed my brightness to 0.7.
